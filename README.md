# Hi there, I go by the username  of *Favor-star* 👋
#### My real name is Eliab Favor IRANKOMEJE, by the way. And I'm Rwandan self-made developer, if you ask. 😍

## About Me

- 🌱 I’m currently learning React and NestJS. (I do like frontend very much however 😍)
- 👯 I'm open to working with anyone. As long as it is codes, I'm the best junior companion you can find.
- 💬 Ask me about anything, just anything. (We might help each other in one way or another. All you have to do is to just ask only).
- 📫 Get to me directly through: [MY PERSONAL EMAIL](favoureliab@gmail.com)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like listening more than talking (I don't know if it is fun fact! You tell me! 😄😄)
